          <p>Discipline Management Plan and Student Code of Conduct</p>
          <p>Vehicles on Campus</p>
          <p>
            High school students who drive to and from school in personal
            vehicles must:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Obtain and appropriately display a student parking permit;</li>
            <li>Park in a designated student parking area on campus;</li>
            <li>Adhere to individual school parking rules; and</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Failure to obtain and appropriately display the required permit or
            to park in an approved student parking area may result in:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Vehicle immobilization (boot);</li>
            <li>Fee assessed for boot removal;</li>
            <li>Loss of driving and parking privileges; and/or</li>
            <li>Other disciplinary action.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Temporary permits may be acquired from an appropriate school office
            by students needing to drive on a short-term basis or using a
            substitute car they do not regularly drive to school. Student
            vehicles are only to be driven in the student parking lots. Student
            drivers are not to enter the bus, faculty, or administrator/visitor
            areas between 6:45 am and 3:00 pm on school days.
          </p>
          <p>
            Student drivers are expected to operate vehicles in a safe manner at
            all times and not in any way to make themselves noticed by the way
            they drive except by courteous and responsible behavior. The maximum
            speed limit in the parking lot is ten (10) miles per hour. Vehicles
            parked on school property are under the jurisdiction of the school.
            The school reserves the right to search any vehicle if reasonable
            suspicions exist to do so. A student has full responsibility for the
            security of his/her vehicle and should make certain that it is
            locked and that the keys are not given to others. A student will be
            held responsible for any prohibited objects or substances, such as
            tobacco, alcohol, drugs, or weapons, that are found in his/her car
            and will be subject to disciplinary action by the District as well
            as referral for criminal prosecution for having such objects or
            substances on school property. Searches of vehicles may be conducted
            at any time there is reasonable suspicion to do so, with or without
            the presence of the student. Students who park on campus must adhere
            to all regulations outlined in student handbooks.
          </p>
          <p>
            If a vehicle subject to search is locked, the student shall be asked
            to unlock the vehicle. If the student refuses, the District shall
            contact the student's parents. If the parents also refuse to permit
            the vehicle to be searched, the District may contact local law
            enforcement officials and turn the matter over to them.
          </p>
          <p>[See FNF (LOCAL)]</p>
          <p>
            Katy ISD is not responsible for damage to vehicles or items in
            vehicles parked on campus at any time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Illegally parked cars may be towed or impounded by a boot locked on
            a car tire at the owner's expense. High school students should
            remove all items needed during the school day from vehicles parked
            on campus when they arrive in the morning. Students are prohibited
            from being in the parking lots except upon their arrival and
            dismissal from school. Students who return to a vehicle during the
            school day, without prior approval, may be disciplined and may be
            subject to having the vehicle searched.
          </p>
          <p>
            A campus administrator may terminate a student's driving privileges
            at any time that he/she feels this action is appropriate (i.e.
            excessive tardies and truancy). Loss of driving privileges does not
            allow another student driver to drive the offender's vehicle while
            he/she (the offender) rides as a passenger.
